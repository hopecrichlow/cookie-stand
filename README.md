#Calculate Daily Sales Projections

1. Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
2. Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour.
3. Calculate simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour using average cookies purchased and  the random number of customers generated
4. Store the results for each location in a separate array
5. Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
6. Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

    Pike Place Market
    - 10am: 56 cookies
    - 11am: 77 cookies
    - 12pm: 93 cookies
    - 1pm: 144 cookies
    - 2pm: 119 cookies
    - 3pm: 84 cookies
    - 4pm: 61 cookies
    - 5pm: 23 cookies
    - Total: 657 cookies

Display the lists on index.html.

Here are the starting numbers that you'll need to build these objects:

Location        | Min / Cust | Max / Cust | Avg Cookie / Sale
----------------|------------|------------|-------------------
Pike Place      |      17    |     88     |        5.2
SeaTac Airport  |      6     |     24     |        1.2
Southcenter     |      11    |     38     |        1.9
Bellevue Square |      20    |     48     |        3.3
Alki            |      3     |     24     |        2.6


#Style Guide

1. A custom Google font for highlights
2. A specified standard san-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
3. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
4. Specified different font colors for all three font usages
5. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
6. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
7. Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity,  and consistency are good things in design.
